NekoHTML Readme
===============

Building
--------

You can build NekoHTML by typing the following command:

  > ant (target ...)

The default target will build the entire package.

To build NekoHTML, you need Ant and Xerces2. The first time 
you try to build, it will attempt to download the necessary 
packages. If you already have Xerces and want to avoid this
step, place the Xerces jar files in the lib/ directory.
