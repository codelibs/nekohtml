<h2>Releases</h2>
<dl>
 <dt>Version 0.6.1 (23 May 2002)
 <dd>Changed tag balancer behavior to swallow events after the close 
     of the &lt;html&gt; tag to ensure that the document stream 
     remains well-formed;
     added additional Ruby elements;
     and
     improved tag balancer performance.
 <dt>Version 0.6 (12 May 2002)
 <dd>Added property to allow custom document filters to be appended
       to the default NekoHTML parser pipeline;
     added convenience filters for serializing HTML documents and
       removing elements from the document event stream;
     added samples to demonstrate the filtering feature;
     added <font color=red>experimental</font> functionality to
       allow applications to dynamically insert content into the
       HTML document stream;
     added a minimal Xerces2 Jar file containing just the files
       required for using the HTMLConfiguration class directly to
       alleviate full dependence on Xerces2 distribution;
     applied patch from Serge Proskuryakov to fix handling of 
       misplaced &lt;title&gt; within &lt;body&gt;;
     fixed minor tag balancing bug;
     and
     re-organized and added new documentation.
 <dt>Version 0.5 (07 May 2002)
 <dd>Fixed some location reporting information bugs and added 
       feature to report character boundaries of events via the
       associated augmentations object;
     added feature to disable tag balancing;
     and
     added features to notify handlers of start and end of character
       and built-in XML and HTML entity references.
 <dt>Version 0.4.1 (03 May 2002)
 <dd>Fixed some unquoted attribute value scanning bugs reported
       by Xiaowei Jiang;
     fixed hack for Xerces 2.0.1 reported by Ron Cemer;
     now passing locator object to <code>startDocument</code>
       method;
     and
     celebrated opening of the Spider-Man movie.
 <dt>Version 0.4 (14 Apr 2002)
 <dd>Added properties to control case of element and attribute names;
     changed behavior of parser so that only known HTML elements
       have their names modified according to the properties &mdash; all
       unknown tags are left as-is;
     added property to set default encoding;
     added feature to augment infoset to report "synthesized" events;
     added feature to be able to report errors and localized the error
       messages;
     implemented the locator so that location information can be
     reported;
     and
     fixed element information so that more elements are properly
     scanned as "special".
 <dt>Version 0.3.3 (02 Apr 2002)
 <dd>Separated <tt>META-INF/services/*</tt> files to separate Jar
     so that HTML parser configuration selection can be controlled 
     more explicitly; added DOM and SAX parser classes for 
     convenience; and fixed bug so that parser now obeys the
     encoding specified in the input source.
 <dt>Version 0.3.2 (15 Mar 2002)
 <dd>Fixed problem with bare &lt;input&gt; elements appearing outside
     of &lt;form&gt; tag.

 <dt>Version 0.2.2 (17 Feb 2002)
 <dd>More bug fixes to allow the parser to be used with Xalan
     2.3.0. The parser wasn't keeping track of features and
     properties and without namespaces turned on, Xalan would
     not correctly transform the SAX events emitted using 
     NekoHTML.
 <dt>Version 0.2.1 (16 Feb 2002)
 <dd>Minor bug fix to work around problem in Xerces 2.0.0 SAX 
     parser that drops attributes when parser configuration

 <dd>Adding support for UTF-8, UTF-16, and other 8-bit encodings
